<P>         Following up after the immediate aftermath of the failed assassination attempt on Oswald Mosley, a fascist politician. The IRA calls tommy and informs him he will depend on Oswald for a little longer and that they'll drop off the bodies that lost their lives because of the attempt. The bodies turn out to be, tommy's comrade Barney, gypsy hitman Aberama Gold and Aunt Elizabet “Polly” Gray, the Shelby company's treasurer and tommy's closest advisor. Tommy goes to Miquelon Island to make a deal where he offers to sell them opium to Micheal Gray, his nephew who has rough relations with Thomas. Micheal has huge ties with the Boston mafia run by his wife's uncle, jack nelson.  Tommy tricks Micheal and alerts the authorities that Micheal is carrying opium, thus Micheal goes to jail. Tommy's then meets up with Micheal's wife Gina in Boston and insists that the deal needs to happen. Tommy's wife lizzie, tells tommy that their daughter has come down with a sickness. Tommy visits Micheal in prison and tells him that jack and Gina is coming to London for their business and Micheal isn't invited. </P>
   <p> Tommy gets back home to his daughter and lizzie complains that tommy isn't there for his family. Tommy says that he has one more plan to take care of. Tommy plans to introduce jack which appears to be a fascist supporter to Laura McKee of the IRA as well as Mosely. Meanwhile his daughter gets sick again and is diagnosed with TB. Tommy goes to the mountains after believing that it is a gyspy curse but as he comes back lizzie is sobbing, and tells tommy that she is dead. Tommy then gets a letter from his doctor who tells him that he has tuberculoma and has a year to live. After getting released Micheal plans to kill tommy Shelby because he thinks that he is the one who caused the death of polly. He tips of the IRA about the whereabouts of his brother Arthur. When the IRA and Laura McKee arrives to kill Arthur, Arthur knows that they're coming and kills the IRA members along with Laura McKee. When tommy goes to Miquelon to finish their deal, tommy knows of Micheal's plans before hand and kills Micheal and his associates. Tommy blows up his manor and leaves his family without telling them about his disease. Knowing that he does not have much time left tommy rides to the middle of nowhere and attempts suicide. When he was just about to pull the trigger, he realizes that his doctor was in Mosley's wedding. Tommy goes to the doctor's house and he then puts a gun to the doctor's head realizing that this whole tuberculoma thing was merely a ploy to make tommy go out with his own terms. Tommy decides to spare the doctor as the bell symbolizing armistice rung.
