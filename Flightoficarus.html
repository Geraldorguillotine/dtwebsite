            <p>Flight of icarus is a song by british heavy metal band iron maiden. One of Iron Maiden's most famous songs, it was the band's first single composed entirely by members other than Steve Harris, credited to Adrian Smith and Bruce Dickinson. 
                The song is based on the Greek myth of Icarus, who was held captive in the palace of Knossos on the island of Crete together with his father Daedalus. They construct wings out of feathers and wax so they can escape. Unfortunately, Icarus didn't listen to his father's caution and flew too close to the Sun, melting the wax that secured the feathers, causing him to crash into the water and perish.    </p>
                <p> This version depicts a man who may or may not be the protagonist's father standing on a hillside and having a nameless old man with piercing eyes. Icarus, an unknown kid who enters from the crowd, makes prolonged eye contact with the man. He claims to the audience that he flies in the name of God. "Fly on your wings like an eagle," the chorus exclaims, adding that the goal is to reach the sun. His eyes become cloudy as he soars and "flies on the wings of a dream." Then, realizing that his father has either been deceived (if the old man is not his father) or has betrayed him (if the guy is his father), his wings turn to ash. then passes away. But the chorus keeps asking for someone to fly and touch the sun.
