<p>Wish you were here is the title track to the critically acclaimed album with the same name performed by prog rock band pink Floyd and written by roger waters and David Gilmour. It has been voted 18th best rock song by listeners of New York City's Q104.3. In the original album version, the song segues from "Have a Cigar" as if a radio had been tuned away from one station. 
    Roger waters and Gilmour barely got along when the album was recorded. One day in the middle of those sessions' waters heard Gilmour strumming a riff on his guitar, a riff which resonated with waters. He then penned some lyrics, lyrics that was inspired by Syd Barret (original lead vocalist who turned insane and the band kicked him out. The album by the same name as wish you were here has themes about Syd Barret's time in pink Floyd and it even features a song dedicated to Syd Barret , shine on you crazy diamond.) but also the distance waters felt with the rest of the band. It only took waters 1 hour to write wish you were here.
