            <p>The rime of the ancient mariner is the longest major poem written in 1797-1798 and published in 1798 in the first edition of lyrical ballads by the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge. The rime of the ancient mariner tells the story of a mariner who returned from a voyage. The marine narrates the story when he stops a man who is going to a wedding ceremony. The poem uses many figurative languages such as personification and uses repetition to create the sense of danger.</p>



           
<p id="p0">the poem starts by introducing us to the ancient mariner who stops a wedding guest. The mariner tells the tale of a ship. He begins with the ship leaving the harbour and the ship faces a huge storm that blew the ship into the south pole. A bird, an albatross breaks the harsh cold and fogs of the south pole. The sailors greet it as a good omen and the wind propelling the ship proves it to be so. The mariner then shoots the albatross with a crossbow without any reason. At first sailors the sailors are furious with the mariner. However, after the bird has been killed, the ship blows further to into the pacific. The crew believes that the bird was the source of the fog. But then the ship gets trapped in the sea and the sailors and mariner become thirsty. The sailors' dreams of a spirit and the crew hangs the albatross around the mariner's neck. The men on the ship grow so thirsty that they cannot even speak. Sailors begin to die of thirst and the mariner ends up being the only one alive. surrounded by the dead sailors, the mariner prays. It is only in the moonlight the mariner notices a water snake. The mariner becomes inspired and realizes that all of god's creatures are beautiful. With this realization the albatross fell from his neck and sunk into the sea. The mariner finds the dead sailors bodies become reanimated by angels and work the ship. Powered by the angels the ship races back towards home. The mariner sees a small boat on which a pilot, the pilot's boy and a hermit approach. As they get closer the mariner ship, it suddenly sinks. The mariner wakes up in the pilot's boat, and the mariner rows them on to land. He begs for the hermit to grant him absolution for his sins. The mariner concludes his tale by explaining that as he travels, he is always plagued by the compulsion to tell his tale and experiences agony if he doesn't. the moral of the story is that we need to pray and love all god's creations. He leaves the wedding guest a sadder and wiser man</p>
