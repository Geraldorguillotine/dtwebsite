            <p>Witches' Sabbath  or The Great He-Goat (Spanish: Aquelarre or El gran cabr√≥n are names given to an oil mural by the Spanish artist Francisco Goya, finished sometime between 1821 and 1823. It features Satan in the form of a goat in a moonlit silhouette over some terrified witches. This painting explores themes of violence, intimidation, aging and death. This painting is one of 14 Goya paintings plastered on the walls of goya's residence, Quinta del sordo, that are called the black paintings. The paintings were completed in secret: he did not title any of the works or leave a record of his intentions in creating them. Goya was then around 75 years old, living alone and suffering from acute mental and physical distress.</p>
