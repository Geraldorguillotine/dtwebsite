<H3>Chapter 1-Colter</H3>
</center>

<p>      The year is 1899, the life of the outlaws is coming to an end. After the failed blackwater heist also known as the “blackwater massacre” (a failed ferry heist and violent shootout in the town of blackwater), the van der Linde gang were forced to flee into the grizzly mountains. The freezing stormy conditions in the mountains made the gang desperate to seek shelter. Thanks to Arthur (the protagonist), the gang finds refuge in a small mining town called Colter. With The van der Linde gang, half frozen and starving they do everything in order to survive and await a break in the weather albeit one member, Davey Callender dies due to exposure. </p>
  <p> Dutch (the leader) and Arthur (Dutch's right-hand man) along with Micah (a new member) tries to rob a house to get supplies, however they find out that the house had already been robbed by a rival gang called the O'Driscoll's. After winning the gunfight Arthur finds a woman called Sadie Adler whom her husband had been killed by the rival gang prior to the arrival of Dutch's gang. Dutch then offers to help her and they ride back to colter. In the next couple of days Arthur helps around in the camp as much as he can. He rescues john Marston (partner of Abigail and father to jack) with Javier, hunts with Charles and steals plans from the O'Driscoll's. the latter would be important to the story, because firstly they kidnapped Kieran and secondly it is revealed that the O'Driscoll's were planning to rob a train belonging to the infamous industrialist and financial supporter of the Pinkerton detective agency Leviticus Cornwall. Dutch, being the ambitious leader he is, has a plan to rob the train and goes with the idea thus attracting the attention back to his gang which will be detrimental to the next couple of chapters. After the weather clears up the gang packs up and seeks greener pastures in the state of new Hannover.</p> 
<center><h3>Chapter 2-Horseshoe Overlook</h3></center>

<p>Because the gang left most of their money and stuff near blackwater, the gang needs money. The gang then does all sorts of whacky antics in order to get money. the gang's camp is right outside of a small muddy livestock town called valentine filled with ripe opportunity to get money. Arthur and hosea (old wise founding member of the gang) go bear hunting, The girls (Karen, tilly and Mary-Beth) rob people in town and Arthur has to save them, the gang goes to do "a social call" with the O'Driscoll's and Kieran saves arthur, reverend Swanson gambles and almost gets hit by a train. Arthur also gets himself in heaps of trouble. He gets himself in a barfight, gets drunk with lenny and gets chased by lawmen, becomes the fists in the loansharking operations of strauss, and they also save two members of their gang, firstly, Micah bell who's being held captive in strawberry and Sean Maguire who's stuck in blackwater being held by bounty man. Arthur also tries reconnect his old love, Mary Linton. Arthur saves Mary's brother from a turtle cult called “chelonia”. The gang (Arthur, john, Charles) along with their big mouthed Irishman Sean pisses off Cornwall and the Pinkertons some more by first stealing Cornwall's oil wagon and then robbing a train.    </p>
   <p>At the end of this chapter, john and Arthur robs some sheep, and tries to sell it back in the town of valentine. Arthur goes into a saloon with Dutch and suddenly, Cornwall's men threaten both of them outside and holding john and Strauss hostage. Arthur and Dutch then have a massive shootout in valentine, leaving them with a massive bounty on their heads and the gang is forced to flee to find another campsite which they do, in Clemens point. To clear the camp Arthur saves a particular German family which will be important to the story after.</p> 
    <center> <h3>Chapter 3-Clements Point</h3></center>
   
    <p>      The gang is hiding from the Pinkertons and Cornwall but they still need money. The gang's camp is near the town of Rhodes, a rundown town in the south with a certain antebellum charm with it. The town of Rhodes is also gripped by a huge feud between two rich families who runs things in the region, the Braithwaites and the Grays, and with Dutch being the massive conman he is, plans to play both sides and run away with their money. Arthur runs errands for both the Grays and the Braithwaites to get a one up over each other. The gang also robs more people to get more money by robbing valentine again and they try to make peace with the O'Driscoll's but it fails as Arthur gets captured and he has to escape.</p>
    <p>  At the climax of this chapter both families realizes that they're getting played by Dutch's gang, thus the Gray's ambushes Arthur, Micah, Bill and Sean and gets into a massive shootout, with the latter ending up with his head blown open. When they go back to the camp, a distressed Abigail says that his son, jack is missing and Kieran says that the Braithwaite took him. The whole gang then go to the Braithwaite's manor and finds Catherine Braithwaite (matriarch of the family) and she says that a man by the name of Angelo Bronte took him. The gang then kills everyone there and burns the manor to the ground. With things going out atrociously in Rhodes and realizing that Angelo Bronte is in “the new Gomorrah” saint denies, the gang flees to find a new camp down south.

The gang has another shootout in the middle of saint Denis and Dutch gets a concussion. Dutch is convinced that they need to rob the saint Denis bank and to do that he wants to kill Bronte first because he basically owns the town. Hosea argues to Dutch and says that he's damming us all with his fantasy of robbing a bank to opening a mango farm in Tahiti. Arthur sides with Dutch and he helps Thomas, a person who can hook them up with a boat to go to the Bronte estate. The gang then breaks into the Bronte estate and kidnaps Angelo Bronte.
