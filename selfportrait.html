            <p> Self-portrait with bandaged ear is a self-portrait by Dutch painter van Gogh. The painting tells a story of when van Gogh moved to arles and invited fellow painter Gaugin, whom he had befriended earlier in Paris to come and stay with him. Gaugin and van Gogh had numerous arguments and at one instance Van Gogh had a seizure during which he threatened Gauguin with a razor, but then injured himself, severing part of his left ear. When Gauguin returned the following morning, he discovered that the police had arrived at the house, and blood was splattered in every room. Van Gogh had severed an artery in his neck, and was in grave health after losing so much blood but he recovered in the hospital. Throughout his life, Van Gogh continued to suffer from similar fits, sometimes characterized by acute paranoia.</p>
