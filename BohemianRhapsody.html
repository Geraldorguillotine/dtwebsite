<p>Bohemian rhapsody is a 6-minute song performed by the prog rock turned mainstream pop rock band queen. Written by lead singer, icon Farokh Bulsara aka Freddie mercury, this song is notable for having no chorus and several sections; an intro, ballad, epic solo, operatic segment, a hard rock part and coda. Mercury referred to this song as a “mock opera” that resulted from the combination of three songs he had written. The song was recorded at 5 studios between august and September 1975. This song is often regarded as one of the best songs of all time and is often regarded as the band's signature song</p>
<p>The lyrical contents of this song talk about the personal struggles of Freddie mercury being queer. Some people have speculated that this song is Freddie admitting or coming out that he was gay. Bohemian rhapsody opens up with a confused man (“is this the real life or is this just fantasy, caught in a landslide or is this just fantasy”). As a queer man, Freddie is confused with his life but he decides to open his eyes or embracing his identity. Mercury then describes himself as a poor boy who needs no sympathy. The ballad part tells the story of a murderer confessing to his mother. the murderer pulls out a gun to a man's head and pulled the trigger. The murderer tells his mom to be strong and apologizes to her. The murderer is faced with a noose or death that he fears and he tells his mother to carry on if he dies. This verse is filled with double meanings. The idea of killing a man and putting a gun against a man's head could mean having a sexual relationship with someone. The confession to the mother mirrors a coming out confession typically experienced by queer people. Coming out could be as good as dead to some people. For queer people like Freddie mercury who was Persian and his parents probably wouldn't accept that he is queer, for him it might be like facing death to confess to them. Embracing your true identity also means killing off your former self. In the operatic section, tells a story of Freddie's inner self fighting each other. The line about stoning is strong once you've realized that stoning is typically done to queer people in Abrahamic religions. The outro is Freddie having peace as he realizes that what people think won't change and it doesn't matter to him</p>
