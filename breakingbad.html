<P>      Walter white is a 50-year-old unremarkable chemistry teacher facing a midlife crisis who is diagnosed with lung cancer. He keeps in from his pregnant wife Skyler, and his son. Walt rides along with his DEA brother-in-law hank on a raid on a meth lab. He sees his former student Jesse Pinkman escape the raid. Walt realizes that he can make a lot of money to pay for his lung cancer treatment by cooking and selling meth as he is proficient with chemistry, thus he asks for Jesse's help. The pair sells it to Jesse' former partner Emilio. Realizing that walt was in the raid Emilio, and his partner krazy-8 tries to kill walt and Jesse but walt outsmarts them and kills Emilio with phosphine gas. Walter locks krazy-8 in the basement of Jesse's house but krazy-8 tries to stab walt so walt strangles krazy-8. To get rid of their bodies walt and Jesse comes up with the plan to dissolve their bodies with acid. The incompetent Jesse fails to listen to Walt's instructions and makes a huge hole in the bathtub from dissolving their bodies with acid. As Jesse and Walt's meth begins to spread and become famous, hank looks for the new drug kingpin not realizing that it is his own brother-in-law.</P>
<p>       Walter reveals Skyler, walt jr, hank and his wife Marie that he has cancer but he promises that he will always look after his family. Jesse who becomes paranoid of the law enforcement, visits his family's house. He covers for his younger brother who smokes marijuana and, his utterly disappointed parents kick him out as he believes the marijuana is his. Walt attends his old successful friend Elliot. Elliot owns a company that walt co-founded called grey matter. Elliot offers to help for Walter's treatment, but walt feels insulted by the offer. Walter finally agrees to undergo chemotherapy and he tells Skyler that he accepts Elliot's help when actually he is lying and pays for the chemo with meth. Walt and Jesse find a distributor by the name of taco Salamanca. When Jesse demands and upfront payment, the crazy and hot-headed Tuco, beats him up and steals the meth. Walt later confronts Tuco and forces him to pay for the meth. They even agree to have more deals done with the both of them. When walt and Jesse face difficulties producing a large amount of meth which they promised to make for Tuco, they steal a barrel of methylamine to produce more meth. When it is time for the drug deal, Tuco arrives with two associates, no doze and gonzo.  No doze makes and offhanded remark to walt and Tuco becomes enraged and beats him to death</p>
