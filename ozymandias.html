            <p>Ozymandias is a literature written by the English romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley. It was frst published in the 11 January issue of the examiner of London. Shelley wrote the poem in friendly competition with his friend and fellow poet Horace Smith who also wrote a sonnet on the same topic with the same title. The poem is about the fate of history and the ravages of time. Even the biggest empires and the strongest men aren't forever, their legacies fated to decay into oblivion. "Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!", exemplifies the arrogance a leader who believed his empire would exist forever
                "Ozymandias" is a sonnet, that is written in loose iambic pentameter, but with an atypical rhyme scheme. The theme. Ozymandias is first and foremost a metaphor for the ephemeral nature of political power, and in that sense the poem is Shelley's most outstanding political sonnet, trading the specific rage of a poem like “England in 1819” for the crushing impersonal metaphor of the statue.
